This chart shows money made by the service is constant between January to May. The cities with the biggest revenues are ubarn next to suburban and rural areas. This makes sense because Urban cities are expected to have more people as compared to suburban or rural areas, thus reflect in their revenue outcome.

There are about five times more drivers in Urban areas as versus Suburban areas, and over twenty times more than of Rural areas. Considering the income raised, like the average fare per ride is 20% less in Urban than Suburban Cities, and 30% lesser in Urban cities as oppose to Rural areas. In terms of average fare per driver Urban and Suburban were dominated by Rural drivers.
