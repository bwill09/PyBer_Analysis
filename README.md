# PyBer_Analysis

### Analysis Overview:
This challenge purpose is to project a visualizaton for PyBer ridesharing data. To enhance the ride-sharing service in terms of avalability in neighbourhood of low income. 

##### Resources: CSV File 

##### Software: Python 3.7, Anaconda, Jypyter Notebook 

##### Multiple line chart explains ride sharing data within various city types

#### Fare by City Type

This chart shows how much money made by the service is constant between January to May. The cities with the biggest revenues are ubarn next to suburban and rural areas. This make sense because Urban cities are expected to have more people as comparte to suburban or rural cities, thus reflect in their revenue outcome. 

#### Summary Dataframe with Cost by City Type 

The below image represents stats that the multiple line chart did not. For example, there is difference in the number of rides in rural, suburban and urban cities. There are about five times more drivers in urban areas as compared to suburban areas, and over twenty times more than of rural areas. Considering the income raised, liek the average fare per ride is 20% less in urban cities than suburban, and 30% lesser in urban cities as oppose to rural areas In terms of average fare per driver Urban and Suburban were dominated by rural drivers.

#### Concluson

(a) Customers in Rural areas pay more and have less access to the ride-sharing service as opposed to Urban or Suburban cities. 
(b) Urban cities makes the highest revenue for PyBer 
(c) Drivers earn less in Urban cities due to less cost per ride
